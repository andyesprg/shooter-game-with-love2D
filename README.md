# shooter game with love2D
 This is a space game where you have to try to survive to enemies, good luck!
 ***
 
 I am new at Love2D, but I started this project with a tutorial of 200 lines of code and then, with some help, I finished this game with 1600. 
 This code can be long for the newbies like me, so I tried to explain (in spanish) the functions for each part of it.
 ***
 
 Here, I will explain the controls of the game:
 + You will need the **arrows** of your keyboard to move the spaceship.
 + You can shoot with the space and throw a missile pressing key "**B**".
 ***
 **Watch out for enemies!**
 + The aliens can kill you with only touching them. If you kill them, a purple heart will appear, **don't touch it!** If you do it, you will loose one heart.
 + The enemies' spaceships can shoot sometimes, so try to kill them before they took you one heart. And obviously, if you touch them, you will loose one heart.
 ***
 It could sound like there is no way to suvive in this game, is for that reason that I add some cool things that you would enjoy.
 + First of all, I added **red hearts** (lives) that you can collect.
 + Sometimes, when you kill enemies' spaceships, it would appear a **mushroom** that will grant you a different shoot for your spaceship, each mushroom matches with the color of the shoot, so pay attention on what you catch.
	
 This game is so simple, it doesn't even have levels, but I hope you can use it to learn how lua works.

 P.S. You can move Spock (it's the little boy on the menu, I know, it's a bit poor) just try to press the keys of the letters of his name and the magic *will appear*.
